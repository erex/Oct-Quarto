While I intend to discuss the solutions to every practical, I want you to have the opportunity to do some self-assessment either before we discuss the solution together, or if you choose to return to a practical sometime in the future.

I have created a few short answer/multiple choice questions to accompany Practicals 2-8. These tutorials re-create output from the practicals and ask you to interpret that output.

In some tutorials, I ask you to complete a short bit of R code to perform some calculations (hints are provided to help you do this). In all tutorials I ask you to step back from pouring over output and ask to to make biological interpretations.

## Don't worry about selecting incorrect answers

There is no "grade" associated with these practicals. The answers you provide cannot be seen by me or your fellow participants. The practicals offer you another opportunity to explore distance sampling analyses. You can assess the results of your explorations through using the practicals.

Use of the practicals is completely optional. If they help you learn about distance sampling analyses, by all means use them. If they interfere with your learning, concentrate on other facets of the workshop materials.
