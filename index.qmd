Eric is trying to build a new website.  This uses RStudio and asked that a Github repo be created as well.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(Distance)
data(LTExercise)
conv <- convert_units("meter", "kilometre", "square kilometer")
hn <- ds(LTExercise, key="hn", convert_units = conv)
```


Now for some results

```{r}
knitr::kable(hn$dht$individuals$D)
```

The end.
