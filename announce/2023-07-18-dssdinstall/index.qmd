# Installing `dssd` from Github

The survey design R package `dssd`, does not currently reside on CRAN because of the dependency `dssd` has upon another package that has been removed from CRAN. This means the process of installing `dssd` onto your computer is only slightly more difficult, I believe.

We develop our packages using a Cloud service called `Github`. You can acquire a copy of the `dssd` package from there to install onto your local computer.  The process is as follows:

- Download a file from Github, dependent upon whether your machine is Windows or Mac:
  - `dssd_1.0.0.zip` for Windows
  - `dssd_1.0.0.tgz` for Mac
  - in either case, the file to download is located at
    `https://github.com/DistanceDevelopment/dssd/releases/tag/dssd1.0.0-R4.2.3`
- Using RStudio, request `Install package from package archive file
  - ![](installmenu.png)
  - pointing the dialog to the location where you downloaded the file from Github
- proceed with your R session with the command `library(dssd)`
  
Note: as I don't have a Mac, the comment about installing from a Mac is untested.
