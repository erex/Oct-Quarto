This exercise is not computer-based. Therefore, you wonâ€™t find anything in my RStudio/Cloud account related to Practical 1. Instead, below find links to an [instruction file](/Pr1/Pr1-instructions.qmd) and a PDF. Print the PDF prior to our first session, because you will work with paper and pencil during the exercise portion of our meeting on that date. The HTML file contains the instructions of what you are to do during the exercise.
