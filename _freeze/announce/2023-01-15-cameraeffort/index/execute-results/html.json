Computation is not difficult, just remember the steps. We use as an example, Howe's Maxwell duiker data.  In his data (`DuikerCameraTrap`) supplied in the Distance package, the effort associated with each camera is\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(Distance))\ndata(\"DuikerCameraTraps\")\nprint(DuikerCameraTraps$Effort[1])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 680232\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis note describes how to that effort was calculated.\n\n# How many days were cameras deployed?\n\nFrom the Methods section of @howeetal, we find the dates of deployment and collection\n\n![](text1.png)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstart <- as.Date(\"2014-06-28\")\nend <- as.Date(\"2014-09-21\")\ndaysbetween <- as.numeric(difftime(end, start, units=\"days\"))\ndaysout <- daysbetween - 1\nprint(daysout)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 84\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOnly days when there was no research presence are included in analysis, hence one day is subtracted from duration of cameras in the field.\n\n# Seconds per day cameras in analysis\n\nData provided in the Distance package is for detections made during \"peak\" activity period for duikers. That peak period is specified further in the Methods section:\n\n![](text2.png)\n\nIn the above snippet of text, @howeetal states there are 8098 snapshot events per day within this peak activity period.  For their cameras, the duration of a snapshot was 2 seconds. Let's recreate that value:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsnapshot.duration <- 2\nmorning.start <- as.POSIXct(\"2014-06-28 06:30:00\" , format=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS\")\nmorning.end <- as.POSIXct(\"2014-06-28 08:59:58\" , format=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS\")\nevening.start <- as.POSIXct(\"2014-06-28 16:00:00\" , format=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS\")\nevening.end <- as.POSIXct(\"2014-06-28 17:59:58\" , format=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS\")\n\nmorning <- difftime(morning.end, morning.start, units=\"secs\")\nevening <- difftime(evening.end, evening.start, units=\"secs\")\ntotal.secs <- as.numeric(morning) + as.numeric(evening)\ndaily.snapshots <- total.secs / snapshot.duration\nprint(daily.snapshots)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 8098\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Snapshot events for entire duration\n\nNearly finished. Multiply daily snapshots by the number of days of deployment:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntotal.snapshots <- daysout * daily.snapshots\nprint(total.snapshots)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 680232\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(total.snapshots == DuikerCameraTraps$Effort[1])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHooray!\n\n# References",
