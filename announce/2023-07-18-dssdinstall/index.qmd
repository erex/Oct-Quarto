# Installing `dssd` from Github

The survey design R package `dssd`, does not currently reside on CRAN because of the dependency `dssd` has upon another package that has been removed from CRAN. This means the process of installing `dssd` onto your computer is only slightly more difficult, I believe.

We develop our packages using a Cloud service called `Github`. You can acquire a copy of the `dssd` package from there to install onto your local computer.  The process is as follows:

- install the `remotes` R package
  - `install.packages("remotes")`
- with the `remotes` package installed, issue this command from the console
  - `install_github("DistanceDevelopment/dssd", build_vignettes=TRUE")`
  
Fingers crossed, that will install the package (and perhaps a few supporting packages also)
