However, simple modelling of counts fails to take into account imperfect detectability. When detectability is imperfect, the response variable possesses uncertainty derived from uncertainty in the probability of detection.\nA number of authors have recognised the need to incorporate this uncertainty into the analysis of habitat effects upon estimated density. One approach (employed here) conducts the analyses in two stages: first detectability is estimated and \\(P_a\\) or \\(\\mu\\) or \\(\\rho\\) is estimated. A second stage fits a model to count data adjusting using the estimated detectability parameters. This approach is exemplified by Buckland et al. (2009). Alternatively, single state approaches have been described by Rodríguez-Caro et al. (2017).\nPropagation of uncertainty from the first step into the second step is accomplished via a bootstrap, with the effective area sampled serving as an offset in the generalised linear modelling (GLM) analysis. The method described herein only applies when the link function is the log link, for the following reason.\nWe want to model bird density in our GLM, derived from the counts we observed on each transect. Density is defined as\n\\[D = \\frac{n}{\\text{Eff Area}} \\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the count on each transect.\nTherefore\n\\[\\frac{n}{\\text{Eff Area}} = e^{\\text{linear predictor}}\\]\nwhen using a log link function.\nOur count model works with n as the response variable\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn &= \\text{Eff Area} \\cdot e^{\\text{linear predictor}} \\\\\n&= e^{\\text{linear predictor} + log(\\text{Eff Area})}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nmaking \\(log(\\text{Eff Area})\\) the offset.

Effective area \\((EA)\\) is computed differently, depending upon whether sampling was done with line or point transects.\n\nFor line transects the computation uses the effective strip half-width \\((ESW)\\) multiplied by 2 (for each side of the transect), multiplied by the transect length. \\(ESW\\) is derived for each detection by acquiring the detection probability for the detection from the fitted detection function object detfnobj$ddf$fitted. However a detection probability is only computed for detections at distances less than the truncation distance; so some coding is required to deal with detections beyond the truncation distance. \\(ESW\\) is derived from \\(P_a\\) as \\(P_a \\cdot w\\) where \\(w\\) is the truncation distance.\nFor point transects, effective area is computed as \\(\\pi \\cdot P_a \\cdot w^2\\). This value is returned directly when the predict() function is used, but is derived by calculation from the fitted detection function object detfnobj$ddf$fitted for each detection.\n\nThere is also a distinction between line and point transect computations regarding units in which data are recorded.

Division by 10000 to convert square meters to hectares.\nBecause only need transect level information, the observation-level information can be removed, to make computation easier. However, transects on which animals were not detected (counts=0) must also be carried forward to the GLM analysis; because 0’s constitute legitimate observations.

    "text": "Prepare for GLM computation\nConsiderable processing is necessary to correctly calculate the offset value for the GLM. The offset is the effective area sampled by each transect. Effective area \\((EA)\\) is computed differently, depending upon whether sampling was done with line or point transects.\n\nFor line transects the computation uses the effective strip half-width \\((ESW)\\) multiplied by 2 (for each side of the transect), multiplied by the transect length. \\(ESW\\) is derived for each detection by acquiring the detection probability for the detection from the fitted detection function object detfnobj$ddf$fitted. However a detection probability is only computed for detections at distances less than the truncation distance; so some coding is required to deal with detections beyond the truncation distance. \\(ESW\\) is derived from \\(P_a\\) as \\(P_a \\cdot w\\) where \\(w\\) is the truncation distance.\nFor point transects, effective area is computed as \\(\\pi \\cdot P_a \\cdot w^2\\). This value is returned directly when the predict() function is used, but is derived by calculation from the fitted detection function object detfnobj$ddf$fitted for each detection.\n\nThere is also a distinction between line and point transect computations regarding units in which data are recorded. For line transect example of Brewers Sparrows, Effort was measured in meters, but we wish to produce our estimates of density in numbers per hectare. With Thresher Sparrows, radial detection distance was measured in meters, but we wish to measure bird density in numbers per hectare. In both cases, division by 10000 to convert square meters to hectares.\nBecause only need transect level information, the observation-level information can be removed, to make computation easier. However, transects on which animals were not detected (counts=0) must also be carried forward to the GLM analysis; because 0’s constitute legitimate observations. If the offset values remained missing values (NA), the relationship between animal density and the predictor covariate(s) would not be properly estimated.\n\neffAreafn <- function(detfnobj, newdata, areaconv, truncation, pointflag) {\n#\n# Input: detfnobj - model object created by `ds()`\n#        newdata - data frame of detections and site-level covariates\n#        areaconv - conversion of transect length units to area units (m2 to ha for example)\n#        truncation - truncation distance for detection function fit\n#        pointflag - TRUE if point transect survey, FALSE for line transects\n#\n# Output: data frame of transects with effective area appended for each transect (to be used as offset)\n#\n  newdata$Pa <- NA\n  k <- 0\n  for (i in 1:dim(newdata)[1]) {\n    if(newdata[i, \"distance\"] <= truncation & !is.na(newdata[i,\"distance\"])) {\n      k <- k+1\n      newdata$Pa[i] <- detfnobj$ddf$fitted[k]\n    }\n  }\n  if(!pointflag) {\n    newdata$effArea <- ifelse(is.na(newdata$Pa), NA, 2 * newdata$Pa * truncation * newdata$Effort / areaconv)\n  }else{\n    newdata$effArea <- ifelse(is.na(newdata$Pa), NA, newdata$Pa * truncation^2 * pi / areaconv)\n  }\n  result <- newdata[!duplicated(newdata$siteID),]\n#    newdata must contain all covariates used in the detection function!  \n  if(!pointflag) {\n#     predict for line transects when esw=TRUE returns the ESW that needs to be converted to effective area    \n    result$effArea <- ifelse(result$myCount==0,\n                              2 * predict(detfnobj, \n                                          newdata=data.frame(obs=result$obs, bare=result$bare,\n                                                             herb=result$herb, shrub=result$shrub,\n                                                             height=result$height),\n                                          esw = TRUE)$fitted * result$Effort / areaconv,\n                              result$effArea)\n  }else{\n#     predict for point transects when esw=TRUE returns the effective area    \n    result$effArea <- ifelse(result$myCount==0,\n                              predict(detfnobj, \n                                          newdata=data.frame(obs=result$obs, bare=result$bare,\n                                                             herb=result$herb, shrub=result$shrub,\n                                                             height=result$height),\n                                          esw = TRUE)$fitted / areaconv,\n                              result$effArea)\n    \n  }\n  return(result)\n}\n\nsitesadj <- effAreafn(woo.o, newsparrow, 10000, dettrunc, pointflag = FALSE)"

Consequently, there were 4 transects without chaffinches on the first visit and 2 transects without chaffinches on the second visit, rather than the 3 transects and 1 transect you might mistakenly conclude do not have chaffinch detections if you relied completely upon the table.\nLet’s see what the ds() function thinks about the survey effort using information from the species-specific data frame.\n\nchaf.wrong <- ds(chaf, key=\"hn\", convert_units = cu, truncation=95, formula = ~Region.Label)\n\nModel contains covariate term(s): no adjustment terms will be included.\n\n\nFitting half-normal key function\n\n\nAIC= 650.999\n\nknitr::kable(chaf.wrong$dht$individuals$summary) %>%\n  kable_paper(full_width=FALSE) %>%\n  column_spec(6, background=\"salmon\") %>%\n  column_spec(7, background=\"steelblue\")\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Region \n    Area \n    CoveredArea \n    Effort \n    n \n    k \n    ER \n    se.ER \n    cv.ER \n  \n \n\n  \n    1 \n    33.2 \n    82.061 \n    4.319 \n    39 \n    15 \n    9.029868 \n    1.1159303 \n    0.1235821 \n  \n  \n    2 \n    33.2 \n    83.562 \n    4.398 \n    34 \n    17 \n    7.730787 \n    0.9798153 \n    0.1267420 \n  \n  \n    Total \n    66.4 \n    165.623 \n    8.717 \n    73 \n    32 \n    8.380327 \n    0.7425191 \n    0.0886026 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nExamine the column labelled k (the number of transects) for each of the visits. Rather than the 19 transects that were surveyed on each visit, the ds() function erroneously believes there were only 15 transects surveyed on the first visit and 17 transects surveyed on the second visit.\nNote also the number of detections per kilometer; roughly 9 on the first visit and 7.7 on the second visit. These encounter rates exclude kilometers of effort on transects where there were no detections. We will return to this comparison later.\n\n\nUse explicit data hierarchy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribing the survey design to ds\n\n\n\nAdditional arguments can be passed to ds() to resolve this problem. Consulting the ds() documentation\n\nregion_table data.frame with two columns:\n\nRegion.Label label for the region\nArea area of the region\nregion_table has one row for each stratum. If there is no stratification then region_table has one entry with Area corresponding to the total survey area.

There are three columns:\n\nSample.Label label for the sample\nRegion.Label label for the region that the sample belongs to.\nEffort the effort expended in that sample (e.g. transect length).\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis that produces erroneous results can be remedied by explicitly letting the ds() function know about the study design; specifically, how many strata and the number of transects within each stratum (and associated transect lengths).\nConstruct the region table and sample table showing the two strata with equal areas and each labelled transect (of given length) is repeated two times.\n\nbirds.regiontable <- data.frame(Region.Label=as.factor(c(1,2)), Area=c(33.2,33.2))\nbirds.sampletable <- data.frame(Region.Label=as.factor(rep(c(1,2), each=19)),\n                                Sample.Label=rep(1:19, times=2),\n                                Effort=c(0.208, 0.401, 0.401, 0.299, 0.350,\n                                         0.401, 0.393, 0.405, 0.385, 0.204,\n                                         0.039, 0.047, 0.204, 0.271, 0.236,\n                                         0.189, 0.177, 0.200, 0.020))\n\n\n\nSimple detection function model\nThe chaffinch analysis is performed again, this time supplying the region_table and sample_table information to ds(). The correct number of transects (19) sampled on both visits (even though chaffinch was not detected on 4 transects on visit 1 and 2 transects on visit 2) is now recognised. Hence, the use of region table and sample table solves the problem of effort miscalculation if a species is not detected on all transects.\n\ntr <- 95   # as per Buckland (2006)\nonlycf <- ds(data=birds[birds$species==\"c\", ], \n             region_table = birds.regiontable,\n             sample_table = birds.sampletable,\n             trunc=tr, convert_units=cu, key=\"hn\", formula = ~Region.Label)\n\nModel contains covariate term(s): no adjustment terms will be included.\n\n\nFitting half-normal key function\n\n\nAIC= 650.999\n\nknitr::kable(onlycf$dht$individuals$summary) %>%\n  kable_paper(full_width=FALSE) %>%\n  column_spec(6, background=\"salmon\") %>%\n  column_spec(7, background=\"steelblue\")\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Region \n    Area \n    CoveredArea \n    Effort \n    n \n    k \n    ER \n    se.ER \n    cv.ER \n  \n \n\n  \n    1 \n    33.2 \n    91.77 \n    4.83 \n    39 \n    19 \n    8.074534 \n    1.2196305 \n    0.1510465 \n  \n  \n    2 \n    33.2 \n    91.77 \n    4.83 \n    34 \n    19 \n    7.039338 \n    1.0612781 \n    0.1507639 \n  \n  \n    Total \n    66.4 \n    183.54 \n    9.66 \n    73 \n    38 \n    7.556936 \n    0.8083641 \n    0.1069698 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsequence of incorrect analysis\nTo drive home the consequence of failing to properly specify the survey effort, contrast the encounter rate for the two visits from the incorrect calculations above (9.0 and 7.7 respectively), with the correct calculation (8.1 and 7.0 respectively).

If effort is incorrect then so too is covered area.\nThe ripple effect from incomplete information about the survey design results in positively biased estimates of density.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBuckland, S.

In this situation, the calculated density of animal cues needs to be transformed into an estimate of animal density. This requires companion field investigations to estimate cue production rate and possibly, cue disappearance rate. Those rates are termed multipliers.\nThis exercise presents data on a Sika deer dung study in southern Scotland, where data on dung disappearance needs to be analysed via logistic regression to produce the disappearance rate multiplier. There is a study of whale blows from a moving ship–effort is measured in units of time rather than distance. Finally, we return to the Montrave Estate study of Prof Buckland to estimate density of winter wrens via detections of song; necessitated because of evasive movement of winter wrens in the field.\nPhoto by Jamshaid Mughal on Unsplash"

We already have estimates of dung production rates but need similar information on dung decay (or persistence) rate.\nData to calculate this has been collected in the file IntroDS_9.1.csv in your directory. Following code comes from Meredith (2017).\n\nMIKE.persistence <- function(DATA) {\n  \n#  Purpose: calculate mean persistence time (mean time to decay) for dung/nest data \n#  Input: data frame with at least two columns:\n#         DAYS - calendar day on which dung status was observed\n#         STATE - dung status: 1-intact, 0-decayed\n#  Output: point estimate, standard error and CV of mean persistence time\n#\n#  Attribution: code from Mike Meredith website: \n#      http://www.mikemeredith.net/blog/2017/Sign_persistence.htm\n#   Citing: CITES elephant protocol\n#      https://cites.org/sites/default/files/common/prog/mike/survey/dung_standards.pdf\n  \n  ##   Fit logistic regression model to STATE on DAYS, extract coefficients\n  dung.glm <- glm(STATE ~ DAYS, data=DATA, family=binomial(link = \"logit\"))\n  betas <- coefficients(dung.glm)\n  ##   Calculate mean persistence time\n  mean.decay <- -(1+exp(-betas[1])) * log(1+exp(betas[1])) / betas[2]\n  ## Calculate the variance of the estimate\n  vcovar <- vcov(dung.glm)\n  var0 <- vcovar[1,1]  # variance of beta0\n  var1 <- vcovar[2,2]  # variance of beta1\n  covar <- vcovar[2,1] # covariance\n  deriv0 <- -(1-exp(-betas[1]) * log(1+exp(betas[1])))/betas[2]\n  deriv1 <- -mean.decay/betas[2]\n  var.mean <- var0*deriv0^2 + 2*covar*deriv0*deriv1 + var1*deriv1^2\n  ## Calculate the SE and CV and return\n  se.mean <- sqrt(var.mean)\n  cv.mean <- se.mean/mean.decay\n  out <- c(mean.decay, se.mean, 100*cv.mean)\n  names(out) <- c(\"Mean persistence time\", \"SE\", \"%CV\")\n  plot(decay$DAYS, jitter(decay$STATE, amount=0.10), xlab=\"Days since initiation\",\n       ylab=\"Dung persists (yes=1)\",\n       main=\"Eight dung piles revisited over time\")\n  curve(predict(dung.glm, data.frame(DAYS=x), type=\"resp\"), add=TRUE)\n  abline(v=mean.decay, lwd=2, lty=3)\n  return(out)\n}\ndecay <- read.csv(\"IntroDS_9.1.csv\")\npersistence.time <- MIKE.persistence(decay)\nprint(persistence.time)\n\nRunning the above command should have produced a plot of dung persistence versus days since produced and fitted a logistic regression (this is like a simple linear regression but restricts the response to taking values between 0 and 1). Note the points can in reality only take values between 0 and 1 but for the purposes of plotting have been ‘jittered’ to avoid over-plotting.\nAn estimate of mean persistence time and measure of variability are also provided - make a note of these as they will be required below.\nAs stated above, we want an object which contains information on the dung production rate (and standard error) and dung decay rate (and standard error). The following command creates a list containing two data frames:\n\ncreation contains estimates of the dung production rate and associated standard error\ndecay contains the dung decay rate and associated standard error where XX and YY are the estimates you obtained from the dung decay rate analysis.\n\n\n# Create list of multipliers\nmult <- list(creation = data.frame(rate=25, SE=0),\n#             decay    = data.frame(rate=XX, SE=YY))\nprint(mult)\n\nThe final step is to use these multipliers to convert \\(\\hat D_{\\textrm{pellet groups}}\\) to \\(\\hat D_{\\textrm{deer}}\\) (as in the equations above) - for this we need to employ the dht2 function. In the command below the multipliers= argument allows us to specify the rates and standard errors. There are a couple of other function arguments that need some explanation:\n\nstrat_formula=~Region.Label is specified to take into account the design (i.e. different woodlands or blocks).\nstratification=\"effort_sum\" is specified because we want to produce an overall estimate density that is the mean of the woodland specific densities weighted by effort allocated within each block.\ndeer.df is the detection function you have fitted.\n\n\n# Weight by effort because we have repeats\ndeer.ests <- dht2(deer.df, flatfile=sikadeer, strat_formula=~Region.Label,\n                 convert_units=conversion.factor, multipliers=mult, \n                 stratification=\"effort_sum\", total_area=13.9)\nprint(deer.ests)\n\nThe function dht2 also provides information on the components of variance. Make a note of the these (contribution of detection function, encounter rate, decay rate and what happened to production rate component?) in each strata."

It is a bit of a scrappy data set, not very many line transects (12), not very many detections (43). As such, it might present a couple of challenges to you, but hopefully not too many. 🕵\n\nThere was one covariate recorded ✍ with each detection–whether the animal was male or female .\nUnits of measure 📏 are: perpendicular distances in meters, effort (transect lengths) in kilometers and area of study region in square kilometers.\n\nDon’t forget to set the units properly\n\nlibrary(Distance)\nconversion <- convert_units(\"meter\", \"kilometer\", \"square kilometer\")\n\nRemember some of the hints I have provided (in decision sequence above) along with decisions you will need to make regarding truncation.\nDo a competent job with your analysis and we will share our findings (preferred model, point estimate of abundance and precision of abundance estimate) on Thursday during the practical session.\nThe data set (in CSV format) is available in the file space of this project, shown in the File panel, named mystery.csv.\nThis will be your first adventure looking at data that is not contained within the Distance package. Therefore, your first analysis task will be to read the data from the .csv file into R for subsequent analysis. Example code below:\n\nmydata <- read.csv(\"mystery.csv\")\n\nWhat happens after this is up to you. 🥴 🤔\n\n\n\n\nworkflow"

In that consumption, you will have to determine the credibility of published findings. Given your skills understanding how to design surveys and analyse data from those surveys, you can apply those skills in assessing the defensibility of work presented by others. This is the intent of the literature critique exercise. Examine one of the three published papers as a critical consumer and make determinations about the credibility of the findings.\nA “mystery” data set is provided to take an analysis from start to finish. With this data set, you will make the series of decisions associated with distance sampling analysis. More importantly, you should emphasize the evidence used to support the decisions made."

Exercises are paced to bring you up to speed with the fundamentals of distance sampling; how this method of population assessment differs from other forms of population sampling. This leads to the introduction of a detection function and ways to model it.\nFurther topics of model selection, assessing precision of population estimates and collection and analysis of point transect data round out the first half of the materials. At this point, you will have acquired sufficient experience to analyse basic distance sampling data.\nThe second half of the material exposes you to slightly more advanced concepts: design of distance sampling surveys, including the use of stratification. Also discussed are analytical methods associated with stratified surveys. This gives way to including predictors other than distance in modelling the detection process. Finally multipliers and methods associated with indirect animal surveys are introduced.\nAs well as the exercises and their solutions, there are numerous supplements, touching upon topics or demonstrating issues related to the analysis of distance sampling data. The supplements are not fundamental to successfully employing distance sampling methods, however, the more you understand tools such as distance sampling (via these supplements), the better you will be able to employ such methods."

Values of \\(\\Delta\\) in this region do not lead to extreme bias in stratum-specific density estimates when the pooled detection function model is used.
