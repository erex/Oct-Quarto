# Received yet another email

Another past participant recently wrote this:

Asking for further details, this histogram of detection distances was revealed:

## Additional model fitting

Model with the lowest AIC was the hazard rate, trying to fit the spike at small distances. The rapid decline of the fitted hazard rate model resulted in the very low estimate of detection probability. The alternative model described would be the half normal (shown below).

The issue isn't so much which model is better, but rather whether the histogram of perpendicular distances is to be believed. What causes the number of detections to fall from ~55 at distances <200m, to ~35 at distances 100-200m.

The spike of detections at small distances is very difficult to fit; thinking hard about data collection protocol for the next survey is a reasonable course of action.
