This exercise is not computer-based. Therefore, you wonâ€™t find anything in the RStudio/Cloud account related to Practical 1. Instead, below find links to an [instruction file](/Pr1/Pr1-instructions.qmd) and a [sketch of the data](../../Pr1/ducknest-graph-paper.pdf) to complete. Print the sketch and use it to fit a detection function to the data and complete the exercise. The HTML file contains the instructions explaining how to estimate duck nest density from your figure..
