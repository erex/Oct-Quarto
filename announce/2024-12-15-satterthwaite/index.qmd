When computing confidence intervals on estimates of abundance or density, we need not only the standard error of the estimate, but also the appropriate degrees of freedom.

The software can then apply this pair of formulas to produce the asymmetrical confidence seen in the output:

$$
\Large
\begin{align}
C &= e^{t_{df,1-\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{ln[1+cv(\hat{D})^2]}} \\
\hat{D}_L &= \frac{\hat{D}}{C} \\
\hat{D}_U &= \hat{D} \cdot C
\end{align}
$$
where $df$ is computed using the Satterthwaite approximation defined as

$$
\Large
d f=\frac{[\operatorname{cv}(\hat{D})]^4}{\frac{[\operatorname{cv}(n)]^4}{k-1}+\frac{\{\operatorname{cv}[\hat{f}(0)]\}^4}{n-p}}
$$
You see the combination of variances of encounters and detection probability elements in the denominator.

As @buckland2001 [p.118] explain

> This (Satterthwaite approximation) lengthens the confidence interval noticeably when the number of replicate lines is small.
