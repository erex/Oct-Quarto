Based on the duiker data found in Distance package.\nauthor: \n  - name: Eric Rexstad\ndate: 02-21-2025\nimage: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1565087918595-8c2af193ecbc?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8NjB8fGNhbWVyYXxlbnwwfHwwfHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60\nbibliography: howeetal18.bib\ncsl: apa.csl\ndraft: false\n---\n\n\n\n# How to calculate effort\n\nComputation of effort for each camera involves a series of steps. Computation is not difficult, just remember the steps. We use as an example, Howe's Maxwell duiker data.  In his data (`DuikerCameraTrap`) supplied in the Distance package, the effort associated with each camera is\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(Distance))\ndata(\"DuikerCameraTraps\")\nprint(DuikerCameraTraps$Effort[1])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 680232\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis note describes how to that effort was calculated.\n\n# How many days were cameras deployed?\n\nFrom the Methods section of @howeetal, we find the maximum (see @sec-more below) dates of deployment and collection\n\n![](text1.png)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstart <- as.Date(\"2014-06-28\")\nend <- as.Date(\"2014-09-21\")\ndaysbetween <- as.numeric(difftime(end, start, units=\"days\"))\ndaysout <- daysbetween - 1\nprint(daysout)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 84\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOnly days when there was no research presence are included in analysis, hence one day is subtracted from duration of cameras in the field.\n\n# Seconds per day cameras in analysis\n\nData provided in the Distance package is for detections made during \"peak\" activity period for duikers. That peak period is specified further in the Methods section:\n\n![](text2.png)\n\nIn the above snippet of text, @howeetal states there are 8098 snapshot events per day within this peak activity period.  For their cameras, the duration of a snapshot was 2 seconds. Let's recreate that value:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsnapshot.duration <- 2\nmorning.start <- as.POSIXct(\"2014-06-28 06:30:00\" , format=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS\")\nmorning.end <- as.POSIXct(\"2014-06-28 08:59:58\" , format=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS\")\nevening.start <- as.POSIXct(\"2014-06-28 16:00:00\" , format=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS\")\nevening.end <- as.POSIXct(\"2014-06-28 17:59:58\" , format=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS\")\n\nmorning <- difftime(morning.end, morning.start, units=\"secs\")\nevening <- difftime(evening.end, evening.start, units=\"secs\")\ntotal.secs <- as.numeric(morning) + as.numeric(evening)\ndaily.snapshots <- total.secs / snapshot.duration\nprint(daily.snapshots)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 8098\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Snapshot events for entire duration\n\nNearly finished. Multiply daily snapshots by the maximum number of days of deployment:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntotal.snapshots <- daysout * daily.snapshots\nprint(total.snapshots)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 680232\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(total.snapshots == DuikerCameraTraps$Effort[1])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis tells us the first sampling station had the camera operating for the full duration of the period (28 June through 21 September). However, that is not the case for all the cameras deployed in the survey.\n\n# But wait, there is more {#sec-more}\n\nThis calculation is fine for the camera placed at the first sampling location. However, if you examine `DuikerCameraTraps$Effort` you will note that the number of snapshot moments differs between stations. If you have conducted field work with camera traps, this comes as no surprise to you. Each camera deployment is unique for several reasons:\n\n- battery failure\n- camera is dislodged by weather, animals or humans\n- time lag between camera deployments and collections\n  - particularly in difficult environments like CÃ´te d'Ivoire, travel time between sampling stations may be several days.\n\nIn the study described by @howeetal, sampling stations were separated by 1km. Consequently, deployment (and camera collection) dates differed among cameras. We can reconstruct the number of days cameras were active by dividing their number of snapshot moments by the number of snapshot moments per day:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstations <- unique(DuikerCameraTraps$Sample.Label)\nstation.effort <- vector(\"numeric\", length=length(stations))\nfor( i in 1:length(stations)) {\n  station.effort[i] <- DuikerCameraTraps$Effort[DuikerCameraTraps$Sample.Label==stations[i]]\n}\nstation.days <- station.effort/daily.snapshots\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nHence the number of days each station was active is shown in the following table:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstation.table <- data.frame(Station=stations, Snapshots=station.effort,\n                            Days=station.days)\nknitr::kable(station.table,\n             caption=\"Days each camera trap station was active for Duiker survey (peak activity)\",\n             align='r')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Days each camera trap station was active for Duiker survey (peak activity)\n\n| Station| Snapshots| Days|\n|-------:|---------:|----:|\n|      A1|    680232|   84|\n|      A2|    129568|   16|\n|      A3|    672134|   83|\n|      A4|    680232|   84|\n|      B1|    680232|   84|\n|      B2|    591154|   73|\n|      B3|    591154|   73|\n|      B4|    502076|   62|\n|      C1|    680232|   84|\n|      C2|    672134|   83|\n|      C3|    655938|   81|\n|      C4|    639742|   79|\n|      C5|    623546|   77|\n|      C6|    647840|   80|\n|      D3|    631644|   78|\n|      D4|    623546|   77|\n|      D5|    542566|   67|\n|      E3|    291528|   36|\n|      E4|    631644|   78|\n|      E5|    583056|   72|\n|      E6|    566860|   70|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# References",
